    <p class="italic text-gray-600 mb-2">By Hassan Jatoi</p>
    <p id="poem1" class="mt-2">
      My heart, a broken violin of time,<br />
      Plays love’s last tune in rhyme sublime.<br /><br />
      The moon weeps soft on my window’s glass,<br />
      Reciting verses of what did pass.<br /><br />
      Her voice, once sunlight, now fades in gloom,<br />
      Leaving perfume in sorrow’s room.<br /><br />
      I breathe her name in the wind’s cold sigh,<br />
      And stars reply with a mournful cry.<br /><br />
      Love died, yet its ghost forever croons —<br />
      In my chest, the Tears of the Moon.

      Beneath my tears, the roses sleep,<br />
      Their fragrance buried, memories deep.<br /><br />
      Each petal sighs with silent pain,<br />
      For love once lost shall bloom again.<br /><br />
      Thy name still burns upon the breeze,<br />
      Like whispered prayers through dying trees.<br /><br />
      The soil drinks grief where passion grows,<br />
      And thorns adorn the grave of rose.<br /><br />
      So let the night in mourning close —<br />
      My heart remains The Grave of Roses.

    Thy lips were dawn, yet night they stayed,<br />
    My heart their promise disobeyed.<br /><br />
    A single breath, so close, so near,<br />
    Yet fate stood still — love drowned in fear.<br /><br />
    The wind did ache to see us part,<br />
    Two trembling souls, one shattered heart.<br /><br />
    I spoke no word, nor didst thou move,<br />
    Silence became the grave of love.<br /><br />
    The stars beheld our yearning crime,<br />
    Two hearts that froze in endless time.<br /><br />
    Thy perfume lingers on my pain,<br />
    As echoes fall like tender rain.<br /><br />
    No kiss to bless, no vow to keep,<br />
    Just dreams that burn when angels sleep.<br /><br />
    And thus, beneath the weeping heaven,<br />
    I mourn A Kiss Never Given.

    Each verse I write becomes my wound,<br />
    In tears and ink, my soul is bound.<br /><br />
    My quill now weeps, my candle dies,<br />
    As grief takes flight through midnight skies.<br /><br />
    The words once kissed by beauty’s grace,<br />
    Now carve thy name on time’s cold face.<br /><br />
    The paper shivers, drenched in pain,<br />
    It feels thy loss in every stain.<br /><br />
    No muse remains to light my art,<br />
    Just echoes sob within my heart.<br /><br />
    Each rhyme, a nail in dreams I built,<br />
    Each sigh, the shroud of tender guilt.<br /><br />
    The poet sleeps where sorrows sing,<br />
    His coffin lined with love’s broken string.<br /><br />
    Beneath the moon, my fate is written —<br />
    Here lies The Poet’s Coffin.

    The moon remembers the ache of our sigh,<br />
    It weeps for the nights that refused to die.<br /><br />
    Your name still burns on the edge of pain,<br />
    A rose in ashes, beneath the rain.<br /><br />
    Dreams I buried beneath my chest,<br />
    Still knock at the door of my broken rest.<br /><br />
    The stars fell quiet when you turned away,<br />
    And time forgot the words to say.<br /><br />
    Every breath I take, a wound untold,<br />
    In silence, my heart turns pale and cold.<br /><br />
    Your shadow walks through my empty hall,<br />
    A ghost of love that haunts it all.<br /><br />
    If love was a sin, then I am its crime,<br />
    Condemned to remember you through time.<br /><br />
    I kiss your memory, though it bleeds,<br />
    For sorrow is the garden where love still feeds.

    I wrote your name on the river’s skin,<br />
    It vanished soft, as sins begin.<br /><br />
    Your laughter lingers, cruel and kind,<br />
    A mirror cracked within my mind.<br /><br />
    My heart’s cathedral burns with shame,<br />
    Each prayer I whisper bears your name.<br /><br />
    Loneliness wears your voice tonight,<br />
    In every silence, I lose the light.<br /><br />
    The world moves on, I stand alone,<br />
    A kingdom of dust, a heart of stone.<br /><br />
    The wind recites our final song,<br />
    Where love was right—but fate was wrong.<br /><br />
    My tears have learned the art of flight,<br />
    They fall like stars into endless night.<br /><br />
    O grief, my crown, my faithful friend,<br />
    You’ll walk beside me till the end.

  <p class="italic text-gray-600 mb-2">By Hassan Jatoi</p>
  <p id="poem9" class="mt-2">
    Once we were fire, now only smoke,<br />
    Love’s fragile glass forever broke.<br /><br />
    You left your scent on my weary soul,<br />
    A wound too deep to make me whole.<br /><br />
    My dreams have turned to haunted seas,<br />
    Where echoes whisper your decrees.<br /><br />
    The candles mourn with shivering breath,<br />
    Their light consumed by living death.<br /><br />
    I speak to the moon, she turns away,<br />
    She too has known a love’s decay.<br /><br />
    Each heartbeat begs for your return,<br />
    Yet finds the silence—cold, stern.<br /><br />
    If heaven could weep, it would tonight,<br />
    For love that died without its right.<br /><br />
    O memory, my sweetest chain,<br />
    Bind me forever to my pain.
